    <p>
      Hi my name is Sunny! I&apos;m a full stack developer currently based in
      Atlanta. Originally from Russia, I came to the United States at the age of
      5, growing up in the Atlanta suburbs and eventually attending Georgia
      Southern University where I got a degree in Computer Science. Since then
      I&apos;ve worked for several companies in the Atlanta Area and have got a
      few cool side hustles as well. If you&apos;re interested in working
      together feel free to reach out.

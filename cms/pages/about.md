pageContent: >-
  Hi my name is Sunny! I'm a full stack developer currently based in Atlanta.
  Originally from Russia, I came to the United States at the age of 5, growing
  up in the Atlanta suburbs and eventually attending [Georgia Southern
  University](https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/) where I got a degree in Computer
  Science. Since then I've worked for several companies in the Atlanta Area and
  have got a few cool [side hustles as well](https://glvn.co/projects).


  If you're interested in working together [feel free to reach out.](https://glvn.co/contact)

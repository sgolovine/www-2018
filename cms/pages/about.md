pageContent: My name is Arseniy Avery (though I go by Sunny Golovine most
  places). I'm originally from Yekaterinburg, Russia, moving to Atlanta when I
  was 5 years old. I attended high school in Atlanta then went on to Georgia
  Southern University where I studied Computer Science. After graduation I've
